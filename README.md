twitterverse
============

We searched twitter for #HackTheUniverse in order to build a model star-planet system (our "twitterverse") for today's event!

We sought to create "planets" out of the most frequent words tweeted around #HackTheUniverse.  The size of the planets, orbital distance, and the eccentricity would be governed by the words' importance (number of uses), visibility (number of followers), and popularity (number of favorites or retweets).

We were able to find the top 10 used words:
1. data
2. apps
3. awful
4. 100
5. fun
6. pruss
7. nightatthemuseum
8. night
9. keunrl81vd
10. weekend

We found a way to calculate 3-d orbits based on orbital distance and eccentricity, plus an orientation angle.

We also worked on visualizing our twitterverse in css and javascript.

We didn't finish the final animation, but we learned a lot! Thank you, #HackTheUniverse and #AMNH
